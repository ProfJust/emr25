You are seeing this warning because `pip.exe` and related scripts were installed to a directory that is **not** included in your system's `PATH` environment variable. This means you won't be able to run `pip` (or any scripts installed by pip) from the command line unless you specify the full path, or you add that directory to your `PATH`[3][6].

To resolve this, you should add:

```
C:\Users\olafj\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python313\Scripts
```

to your `PATH` environment variable.

## How to Add the Directory to PATH

1. **Open Environment Variables:**
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `SystemPropertiesAdvanced`, and press Enter.
   - Click the **Environment Variablesâ€¦** button[1][6].

2. **Edit the Path Variable:**
   - Under **User variables** (recommended), select the `Path` variable and click **Edit**.
   - Click **New** and paste the path above[2][4][5].

3. **Apply and Close:**
   - Click **OK** on all dialogs to save your changes.

4. **Restart Your Terminal:**
   - Close and reopen your command prompt or PowerShell window to apply the changes[6].

## Verifying the Change

Open a new command prompt and run:

```powershell
pip --version
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the pip version information without needing to specify the full path.

**Summary:**  
Adding the Scripts directory to your PATH allows you to use pip and other installed scripts from any command prompt window, resolving the warning and making Python development smoother[3][6].
